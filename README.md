Patch 8.3.0 brought a major overhaul to the Auction House. CollectionShop's Live scan feature is temporarily disabled until it can be fixed.

## Features
* Standalone addon that creates it's own tab on the Auction House for collection shopping.
* Displays models for Mounts, Pets, Appearances, and Recipes in Blizzard's Side Dress Up frame.
* Appearance categories (armor and weapons) and Recipes are for the current player.
* Perform a GetAll or Live scan of the Auction House.
* Buy All - Allows quickly buying all results from first to last (use with caution).

## Filters
* Quality - Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic
* Category, Pet Family
* Not Collected for all modes
* Collected (1-2/3) and Collected (3/3) for Pets
* Collected - Unknown Sources for Appearances
* Collected - Known Sources for Appearances
* Pet Levels
* Required Player Level Ranges (Appearances)
* Group Pets By Species (uncheck to view all level, rarity, breed combos)
* Required Level above player's level
* Requires Profession beyond player's skill
* Requires Riding Skill (Mounts)
* Non-set Items (Appearances)
* Crafted by a Profession

## Options
* **Auctions Won Reminder** - Reminds you to use or equip auctions you've won after leaving CollectionShop
* **Max Item Price** - Discard auctions beyond a desired gold amount (mode specific)
* **Item Value Source** - <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/tradeskill-master">TradeSkillMaster</a> users can use a price source or custom price source to add the result column "% Item Value"
* **Auto-select After Auction Unavailable** - Toggles whether to select the next cheapest auction of the same appearance, same pet, etc. when an auction is no longer available.

## Bugs &amp; Suggestions
Please make sure you have the latest version and post into the Curse.com comments with details and if possible a screenshot. Thank you for taking the time to report an issue, it helps make the addon better for everyone.

## Known Issues
* After closing CollectionShop you must learn the auctions you won to exclude them from future Shop results.
* With the exception of recipe items in "Recipes" mode, items that require a specialization of a profession you've learned (e.g. Gnomish or Goblin Engineer for Engineers) won't be filtered out.
* Alt-Tabbing can reduce your scan speed due to Blizzard's "System &gt; Advanced &gt; Max Background FPS" setting.
* Does not consider connected realms, requires auction data for character's realm.
* **Pets** - A few require reputation with a faction or individual and won't be filtered out.
* Live scan is temporarily disabled until it can be fixed to work with patch 8.3.0+.

## Planned Features
* Fix Live scan feature.
* Filter for uncollected/collected breeds of Battle Pets (suggested by dsmania).
